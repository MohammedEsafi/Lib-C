# Lib-C

This project aims to reimplement portions of the standard C library using system call utility functions. It also involves implementing various data structures, including `graphs`, `queues`, and `stacks`. The primary focus lies in recreating the `printf` function, incorporating most of its features while prioritizing performance, well-structured code, and extensibility. Additionally, `floating-point arithmetic` is converted to string format using a floating-point to string conversion algorithm.

To achieve this, the project utilizes a limited set of C functions and control structure, including:

- `write`
- `malloc`
- `free`
- `exit`
- `while`, and `if`
- The functions of man 3 `stdarg`
